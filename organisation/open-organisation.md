We operate with an inclusive, opt-in engagement model. It is a contribution based [meritocracy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritocracy):

"**Meritocracy** \(merit, from Latin mereō, and -cracy, from Ancient Greek κράτος kratos 'strength, power'\) is a political philosophy that holds that certain things, such as economic goods or power, should be vested in individuals on the basis of talent, effort, and achievement, rather than factors such as sexuality, race, gender, age, or wealth. Advancement in such a system is based on performance, as measured through examination or demonstrated achievement."
