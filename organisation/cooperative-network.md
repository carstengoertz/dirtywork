# cooperative network

From Jesse Walden's piece [https://a16z.com/2019/03/02/cooperatives-cryptonetworks/](https://a16z.com/2019/03/02/cooperatives-cryptonetworks/):

"Cooperatives are participatory enterprises that are owned and operated by their members. Members can be the creators, or the consumers, of the cooperative’s product or service; for instance, Arizmendi Pizza is a co-op where all the pizza makers also operate and own the business \(and probably consume it, too\). Or, take the example of [REI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_Equipment,_Inc) — a consumer cooperative with revenues of $2.9B — where consumers, not just shareholders, also earn a dividend based on the purchases they make.

Cooperatives differ from traditional companies in that they are typically funded by direct member investment, rather than investment from third-party shareholders. This allows members to decide on the values of the enterprise, which don’t necessarily need to be about the maximization of profits. In fact, cooperatives tend to be most successful where there’s alignment on other values such as: 1\) a communal benefit to pooling resources, for economies of scale; and 2\) an attendant desire to avoid anti-competitive or extractive behavior."

"Crypto networks aim for an ownership-control structure that is analogous to cooperative enterprises, where stakeholders are generally the consumers or suppliers of the cooperative’s product or service. This is what is meant by the term "community owned and operated" networks."
