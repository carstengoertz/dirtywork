# DIRTY WORK

Dirty Work is the work we never really wanted to do, like unblocking the drains or taking the trash out. After some decades of not dealing with trash or drains on a global scale, we are left with a rotting mess.

Dirty Work is us, collectively finding new ways of living that help us deal with the knock-on effects of the mess â€“ practically, spiritually and psychologically. It is [shadow work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_lxS_blPvM), both internal and external work. A wave, perhaps post-collapse. 

Dirty Work is a [guild](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guild) of world builders, bringing together designers, writers, technologists, shamans, farmers, [nightcrawlers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8kYDQan8bw) and nomads to share rituals, recipes and remedies for a planet in [despair.](https://dirty.work/Deep%20Adaptation:%20A%20Map%20for%20Navigating%20Climate%20Tragedy%20-%20Lifeworth%20https://www.lifeworth.com/deepadaptation.pdf)
